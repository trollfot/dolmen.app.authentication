Changes
=======

1.0b2 (2010-11-16)
------------------

- Change in IChangePassword. Password can be a plain str or a unicode value
  now (via IProtected). IChangePassword then provides the schema for the form.
  See corresponding change in dolmen.authentication.

- The GlobalRegistry plugin has been fixed. It will no longer trigger
  the AuthenticatedPrincipalCreated event. This solves an important
  bug : the event's handlers used to consider all principals from the
  GlobalRegistry to be authenticated, even the unauthenticated ones.


1.0b1 (2010-07-28)
------------------

- Internationalized the code and added French translation.

- Corrected the role granting UI and exposed it through a contextual tab.

- Improved the tests coverage.


1.0a3 (2010-06-25)
------------------

- The GlobalRegistry plugin no longer raises an error when a principalInfo
  is not Found. Instead, it returns None, as specified by IAuthentication.
  Tests have been added to fix that behavior and the PrincipalFolder's one.


1.0a2 (2010-06-25)
------------------

- The PrincipalFolder no longer raises an error when a principalInfo
  is not Found. Instead, it returns None, as specified by
  IAuthentication.


1.0a1 (2010-06-04)
------------------

- Removed unused and illogical rights: "CanLogin" & "CanLogout".

- ``dolmen.app.authentication`` now uses dolmen.menu to create menus and register entries.

- We now use the ``zeam.form`` Form library instead of z3c.form


0.1.1 (2010-05-31)
